  3. Click the "Calculate" button to calculate the interest.
  4. The calculated interest will be displayed in the "Interest" text field.
# Implementation Details
The program is implemented using Java Swing and follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. The user interface is created using the FlowLayout manager, and the input values are read from JTextField components. The "Calculate" button is connected to an ActionListener that calculates the interest using the input values and displays the result in the output JTextField.
